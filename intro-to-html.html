    <h1>I have a Pixie Bob Cat!</h1>
    <h2>They are really big cats!</h2>
    <h3>My Pixie Bob's name is Rocky</h3>

    <p>The Pixie-bob cat breed is one of the most interesting and unique cat breeds in the world. There are quite a few unanswered questions surrounding the origin of the breed, which dates back more than 30 years, but the Pixie-bob is widely believed to have first appeared around 1985 after a bobcat mated with a barn cat owned by a woman named Carol Ann Brewer. These stories indicate that a litter of kittens was born a short time later and that Carol named one of the female kittens Pixie, thus giving birth to a breed that is now recognized by both the International Cat Association and the American Cat Fanciers Association.</p>
